Make sure you click on "Raw" to see the code properly.

When I was trying to get this done, I had many questions that were not taught during the course, and I could not find what exactly to write to generate the desired outcome. I will add my thoughts below that would have helped me with the knowledge I needed to complete this task completely.

Steps: 
From Anaconda, I launched Jupyter Notebook and created a new kernel. 
Then, for each cell (the horizontal bar that allows you to write stuff on it) write the below. Keep in mind that all cells except cell 5, you have to change it from "code" to "markdown"). On Jupyter Notebook, that option is right below the main menu, towards the right, next to the "run/stop/restart/etc"  symbols.

Cell 1 (Placing one "#" with a space after will make what you write after the space the "h1" header that they are asking for):

# My Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio 

Cell 2 (four "#"s will make what you write bold. If you don't put any "#", it will come out regular. You don't need to place a /n, since it's a markdown cell):

#### Jansen Machado
Mars Exploration Data Scientist

Cell 3:

##### Data Science allows us to better understand, and as a result, make more informed and intelligent decisions, which will accelerate our space exploration capabilities. Nothing excites and interests me more than being part of that.

Cell 4:

### The code below is to display a message that is within the code:

Cell 5 (don't forget to make this cell "code"):

print("Hello, Martians! Take me to your Leader")

Cell 6 (here, I used HTML code):

 Update 1: After doing all this, I went to the next step in the module, which was to submit my assignment. There, it had a markdown cheatsheet which would have been very useful if it was given to students before the assignment had to be done.
